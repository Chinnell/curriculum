#Project 1 - Scavenger Hunt
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/N7dzgjo.png)
##Scope
The main goal of this project is to re-familiarize the students with the skills learned in year 1. The structure of the project is to have many short (<10 lines) programs that all have a point value determined by difficulty. There are many programs to choose from but the length of this project should be made by the teacher's discretion. **The project should end when the teacher feels that all students in the class are ready to move on to project 2.** 



#Before Class
*The teachers should familiarize themselves with the programs in the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md). This will help the teacher prepare for any questions that may arise.
*Have a system for checking off every program a student completes. It is important to keep track of which program each student has completed. This way they cannot submit a program twice. 
* Set up a scoreboard --  either digital or written.
*Printing a copy of the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md) for each student is recommended. 

##Vocabulary
* String
* Variable
* Conditional
* Loop

##References

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following areas. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Technical Vocabulary:**  
While completing this project the students will receive practice hearing and using technical jargon.

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will work in teams to create programs.

**Version Control:**   
While completing this project the student will use Github to store their programs.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will review code from early programs to help write later programs.

**Search Engine Skills:**  
While completing this project the student will look in various libraries for references to the program at hand.

**Command Line:**  
While completing this project the student may choose to run these programs in the terminal.

**Debugging**  
While completing this project the students will need to take earlier programs and debug them in order to create a more challenging program.

##Year One Review
This project will improve upon the following skills from the [Year 1 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AobNdyExPHV5dGRWMVI0QVpnSWYtczZZT2ZyV01kcmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class ask them to set up a github account. If they already have a github account, ask them to login. Explain to the students how the use of version control will help them keep track of their projects. If students are using JSbin to complete today's assignments then they can easily upload to their github.  

##Opening
Explain to the students that today's project is a scavenger hunt. The "clues" are short programs that will refresh their memory.  

##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these key points.
* Programs build on each other, so it is in your best interest to complete them sequentially.
* When completed with a program, save it (This is so the students have a library of programs to reference back to in the future.) 
* Students should raise their hand when a program is complete so a teacher can come over to check it before moving onto the next program.  
* Even though programs build on each other, it is important to complete each program in its own file (there are few expectations, teachers should use their best judgement). 
* Collaboration is encouraged... copying is not!
* Before moving onto a new program the student must have a program checked and their score tallied by a teacher. 
* Prizes will be awarded to the top point earners.


##Project Creation Time
During lab time of this project, students should be broken up into groups and only allowed to use one computer for writing the programs. Other computers may be used but only for research. When a program is done the group may call over a teacher to check their work before moving on to the next program.  

Teachers should be doing three things:  
* Checking completed programs for groups with raised hands. (This will be hectic at the start and should slow down as class progresses.)  
* Assisting groups who need the help
* Updating the scoreboard


##Closing
In closing this project, students should share their programs with the other members of their group. During this time total scores should be counted in order to find the winner.

##Check for Understanding
Before allowing the students to leave, a conversation needs to be had with the class regarding everyone's ability to create these programs. If a student was not pulling their own weight during lab time they will need to complete the project again for homework.

##Homework
Students who did not contribute to the project creation will need to complete the scavenger hunt for homework.
